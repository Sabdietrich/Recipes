# Easy Meal: Recipes Inspired by Graph Theory


This project aims to provide a user-friendly application that enables users to search for recipes based on ingredients while providing a platform for local businesses to sell their ingredients. By using graph theory to
create a network of interconnected recipes, we hope to make it easier for users
to discover and enjoy new recipes, and to expand their culinary horizons.

The Backend of the Website is divided in two main parts. First, to connect
to the Neo4j we used a Driver called GraphDatabase. With these driver we
are able to connect our website with the database in the Neo4j.

So, these allows us to connect and interact with Neo4j databases from the
Python application. It serves as an interface between the Python code and
the Neo4j database. With these we are able to perform various operations
such as querying the database, creating, updating, and deleting nodes and
relationships, and executing complex graph traversals.

The driver provided by the Neo4j package is designed to be efficient and
easy to use. It allows us to establish a connection to a Neo4j database
using the Bolt protocol, which is a binary protocol specifically designed for
efficient communication between clients and the Neo4j server. The driver
handles low-level communication details and provides a high-level API for
executing queries and managing transactions.

So basically, the Neo4j package in Python serves as a bridge between the
Python code and the Neo4j graph database,it enables to use the functionality
and features of Neo4j in our applications.

The other main part is for the Local Markets. For that we created a Sign
up and Login section. After the creation of the account, the local market
owner can put all the information about it, such as the name, place, time it
stays open and all the products and prices available.

After, the information is stored with SQLAlchemy. The primary goal of
SQLAlchemy is to simplify the process of working with databases by providing a unified API that supports multiple database management systems with
a consistent interface.

Then, we can display the information the local markets passed into another page, so that the users are able to check where to buy the ingredients
in the Shop section of the website.

For using the SQLAlchemy, we used Flask, which is a Framework for
Python. Flask handles HTTP-related tasks and request routing, while SQLAlchemy
is used for interacting with the database, providing the Object-Relational
Mapping capabilities and simplifying database operations within the Flask
application. This combination allows us to build robust and scalable web application with a clean separation between the web layer and the data layer.

Also, to make sure that all the information is secured after the local
market create the account, we used a password hash. A password hash is
a cryptographic representation of a password generated by applying a hash
function to the password string. In this case, we used the bcrypt, SHA-256.
This is a one-way transformation that converts the original password into
a fixed-length sequence of characters, typically a string of random-looking
characters.

The purpose of doing this is to securely store the password in a way that
makes it difficult for an attacker to reverse-engineer the original password
from the stored hash. This is important because even if a database containing
password hashes is compromised, the actual passwords remain hidden.
To test the Backend we used the Postman. This Software provides an
interface that allows to interact with APIs and perform the tasks related
to API development and testing. It is important to test the API requests
without the need of having the Frontend ready. This optimizes the process
of creating the website.
